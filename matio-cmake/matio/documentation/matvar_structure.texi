@chapter MATLAB Variable Structure
@section Variable Information
When a MATLAB variable is read or created, all of the information about the
variable (e.g. name, dimensions, etc.) are stored in the MATLAB variable
structure type @code{matvar_t}.
@table @code
@item name
Nul-terminated string that is the name of the variable. The name may be NULL (e.g. for elements of a cell-array), so the field should be checked prior to use.
@item rank
The number of dimensions of the variable. The minimum rank is 2.
@item dims
An array of the number of elements in each dimensions of the variable.
@item class_type
Indicates the class of the variable (e.g. double-precision, structure, cell,
etc.).
@item data_type
Indicates the type of the data stored in the @code{data} field of the MATLAB
variable structure.
@item isComplex
is non-zero if the variable is a complex-valued numeric array.
@item isLogical
is non-zero of the variable should be interpreted as logical (i.e. zero for
false, non-zero for true).
@item isGlobal
is non-zero if the variable should be a global variable. In MATLAB a global
variable is available in all scopes (e.g. base workspace, function, etc.)
@end table

@subsection Sparse Matrix Variables
If a variable's class type is sparse, the @code{data} field of the MATLAB
variable structure is a pointer to the sparse matrix structure
@code{mat_sparse_t}. The sparse matrix structure stores the non-zero elements of
the matrix in compressed column format.

@subsection Structure Variables
If the MATLAB variable structure's @code{class_type} is @code{MAT_C_STRUCT}, the
@code{data_type} field should be @code{MAT_T_STRUCT}. The @code{data} field of
the variable structure is an pointer to an array of @code{matvar_t *}. The
length of the array is @math{numel \times nfields} where @code{numel} is the
number of elements in the structure array (product of dimensions array), and
@math{nfields} is the number of fields in the structure. The order of the
variables in the array is first by field, and then by structure index. For
example, for a @math{2 \times 1} structure array with 3 fields @emph{field1},
@emph{field2}, and @emph{field3}, @code{data} field of the structure variable
is ordered as:

@table @code
@item s(1).field1
@item s(1).field2
@item s(1).field3
@item s(2).field1
@item s(2).field2
@item s(2).field3
@end table

@node Cell Variables
@subsection Cell Variables
If the MATLAB variable structure's @code{class_type} is @code{MAT_C_CELL}, the
@code{data_type} field should be @code{MAT_T_CELL}. The @code{data} field of
the variable structure is a pointer to an array of @code{matvar_t *}. The
length of the array is product of the dimensions array. Each element of the
cell array can be a different type.
